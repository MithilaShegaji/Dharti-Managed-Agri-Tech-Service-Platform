# Dharti-Managed-Agri-Tech-Service-Platform
Dharti is a full-stack agri-tech platform I built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to connect unused landowners with verified farmers. With secure onboarding, admin-driven intelligent matching, and lifecycle management, it ensures trust. The system also captures agronomic data for future ML-based crop recommendations.
